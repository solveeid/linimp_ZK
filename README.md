# linimp_ZK
Implementation of local and global energy-preserving methods applied to the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

Recommended packages/tools: None.

This code is meant as a supplement to [1], and is an implementation of the linearly implicit methods preserving a discrete approximation to local and global conservation laws for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. Please refer to [1] if this code is used in a project. Also implemented are two-dimensional extensions of the fully implicit local and global energy preserving schemes of [2].

This is the first release, so if you have comments and suggestions for improvements, please contact me and I will try to accommodate them.
